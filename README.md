# CloudFlare Dynamic DNS client

This is a simple Dynamic DNS script written in Python for updating CloudFlare DNS A records,  
similar to the classic [ddclient perl script](https://sourceforge.net/p/ddclient/wiki/Home/).

- You can run it as a cron job or a systemd timer.
- It only updates the records if the IP address actually changed by storing a
  cache of the current IP address.
- It checks multiple IP services. If one of them doesn't respond, it skips it and check the next.
- It has an easy to use command line interface.

## Install

# Changelog

**v2.0** breaks backward compatibility for a PyPI release.

The script you need to run is now called `cloudflare-dyndns` and the cache file
also changed. You can delete the old cache manually, or you can leave it, it
won't cause a problem.

The Docker file entry point is changed, so if you pull the new image, everything
will work as before.
